\chapter{Performance evaluation of primitive operations}
    This chapter evaluates the primitive operations we introduced in previous sections. We analyse their performances in three sections:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We first evaluate the convolutions algorithms we previously introduced. Previously, we stated that na√Øve convolution would have $\mathcal{O}$($N^2$) time complexity, while FFT convolution would have $\mathcal{O}$($N$log$N$) complexity. We will evaluate both algorithms to see if what we observe corresponds to theory.
        \item We then evaluate the $\Delta$Q adapter API performances, to see the overhead it introduces into a system.
        \item Lastly, we want to evaluate the Qt framework plotting performances, we believe it is the weakest link in the oscilloscope and thus want to evaluate the QtCharts \cite{qt-charts} class when plotting $\Delta$Qs. 
    \end{itemize}
