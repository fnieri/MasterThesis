\section{Extending the notion of failure}
    Whilst previously we defined as "an input message $m_{in}$ that has no output message $m_{out}$", we extend this definition. If you recall the introduction \ref{timeout}, we introduced the notion of a maximum delay.

    We extend the notion of failure to the following definition:
        \begin{center}
            \textit{"An input message $m_{in}$ that has no output message $m_{out}$ after $x$ seconds"}
        \end{center}
    Where $x$ is the $dMax$ defined by the user. We can leverage this new definition to observe $\Delta$Qs in real time.
