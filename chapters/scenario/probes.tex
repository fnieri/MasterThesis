\section{Probes}

To observe the system under test, the resulting outcomes, the result of causal links and outcome expressions, we must put probes in the system. \\
For each outcome of interest, a probe (observation point) is attached to measure the delay of the outcome, like one would in a true oscilloscope. \\
These probes allow to connect the system under test to the stub, which in turns sends a time series of data to the oscilloscope, which performs statistical computations on all the time series. \\
    Consider the figure below, a probe is attached at every component to measure the delay of N outcome ($p_2, p_3$), the stub will send the outcome instance data for each probe observing an outcome to the oscilloscope, which will measure their respective $\Delta$Qs from the time series data and display them (if chosen by the user). \\
    Another probe ($p_1$) is inserted at the beginning and end of the system to measure the global execution delay. \\
    Thanks to this probe, the user can observe the $\Delta$Q \textit{"observed at $p_1$"}, which is the $\Delta$Q which was calculated from the data received by inserting probe $p_1$. The \textit{$\Delta$Q "calculated at $p_1$"} is the resulting $\Delta$Q from the convolution of the observed $\Delta$Qs at $c_2$ and $c_3$.
