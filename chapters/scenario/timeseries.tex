\section{Time series - Oscilloscope outcome instances}
    Consider a probe $p$ with two distinct sets of events, the starting set of events $s$ and ending set of event $e$. The outcome instance of a message $m_s \rightarrow m_e$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The probe's $p$ name
        \item The start time $t_s$
        \item The end time $t_e$
        \item Its status 
        \item Its elapsed time of execution
    \end{itemize}
    The instance has three possible statuses: \texttt{success, timeout, failure}, it can thus be broken down in the representations, based on its status:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{($t_s$,$t_e$)}: This representation indicates that the execution was successful (t $<$ $dMax$). 
        \item \textbf{($t_s, \mathcal{T}$)}: This representation indicates that the execution has timed out (t $>$ $dMax$). The end time and elapsed time is equal to $t_s + \text{timeout}$ 
        \item \textbf{($t_s, \mathcal{F}$)}: This representation indicates the execution has failed given a user defined requirement (i.e. a dropped message given buffer overload in a queue system). It must not be confused with a program failure (crash), if a program crashes during the execution of event $e$, it will time out since the wrapper will not receive an end message.
    \end{itemize}
    The \textbf{time series} of a probe is the sequence of $n$ outcome instances and can then be easily modeled by $\Delta$Q.

    \paragraph{What can be considered a failed execution?} Imagine a queue with a buffer: the buffer queue being full and dropping incoming messages can be modeled as a failure.

    More generally, the choice of what is considered a failed execution is left up to the user who is handling the spans and is program-dependent. Exceptions or errors can be kinds of failure. 

    On another note, the way of handling errored spans in OpenTelemetry can differ from user to user, so the wrapper will not handle ending and setting statuses for "failed" spans.
