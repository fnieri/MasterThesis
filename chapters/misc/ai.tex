\chapter*{AI disclaimer}
    AI was employed to help with the graphical dashboard in C++ and the triggers, in positioning the elements, refactoring the code so the widgets would properly interact together, helping understand the FFT algorithm and refactoring the server when communication errors occurred. For the dashboard, 25\% of ELOC are \textbf{refactored} by AI, they are the constructors of the widgets which nicely place the widgets on screen. The ANTLR CMake was provided by ChatGPT. In total, of around 6000 ELOC, around 10 to 15\% has been done or refactored by AI, this is mostly composed of the server and dashboard/trigger code. Comments were generated by ChatGPT and reviewed so they would reflect actual code.
    
    In Erlang, it was used to provide documentation and help with TCP communication exceptions. To give an estimate, around 20\% of 350 ELOC are done or refactored by AI and they mostly relate to TCP communication and errors handling. Comments were generated and restructured to present the tools nicely.

    The \textbf{written master thesis} was written \textbf{entirely} without the aid of AI.
