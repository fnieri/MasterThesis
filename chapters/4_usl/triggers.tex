\section{Triggers}
    There are two available triggers which can be selected by the user, the triggers are evaluated on the \textbf{observed $\Delta$Q}.

    Part of future work is extending the available triggers in the oscilloscope. We are aware that the available triggers may not seem much, but they are a sufficient basis to observe the non-linearity of a system and are sufficient to detect overload.
    \subsection{Load}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q can be fired if the amount of outcome instances received for a probe in a sampling window is greater than what the user defines:
    \begin{center}
        \#instances$_{probe}$($\Delta$Q) > maxAllowedInstances$_{probe}$ 
    \end{center}

    \subsection{QTA}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q can be fired if:
        \begin{center}
            $\Delta$Q$_{obs}$ $\nless$ observableQTA
        \end{center}
