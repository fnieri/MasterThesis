\section{Triggers}
    There are two available triggers which can be selected by the user, the triggers are evaluated on the \textbf{observed $\Delta$Q}.

    Part of future work is extending the available triggers in the oscilloscope. We are aware that the number of available triggers may not seem like much. Nut the triggers we provide a sufficient basis to observe the non-linearity of a system and are sufficient to detect overload.
    \subsection{Load}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q \textit{of a sampling window} can be fired if the amount of outcome instances received for a probe in a sampling window is greater than what the user defines:
    \begin{center}
        \#instances$_{probe}$($\Delta$Q) > maxAllowedInstances$_{probe}$ 
    \end{center}

    \subsection{QTA}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q \textit{of a sampling window} can be fired if:
        \begin{center}
            $\Delta$Q$_{obs}$ $\nless$ observableQTA
        \end{center}
