\section{Triggers}
    There are two available triggers which can be selected by the user, the triggers are evaluated on the \textbf{observed $\Delta$Q} of a sampling window.

    Part of future work is extending the available triggers in the oscilloscope. We are aware that the number of available triggers may not seem like much. We believe nevertheless that the triggers we provide are a sufficient basis to observe rare events and detect non-linearity or overload. 
    \subsection{Load}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q \textit{of a sampling window} can be fired if the amount of outcome instances received for a probe in a sampling window is greater than what the user defines:
    \begin{center}
        \#instances$_{probe}$($\Delta$Q) > maxAllowedInstances$_{probe}$ 
    \end{center}

    \subsection{QTA}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q \textit{of a sampling window} can be fired if:
        \begin{center}
            $\Delta$Q$_{obs}$ $\nless$ observableQTA
        \end{center}
