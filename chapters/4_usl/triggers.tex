\section{Triggers}
    There are two available triggers which can be selected by the user, the triggers are evaluated on the \textbf{observed $\Delta$Q}.
    \subsection{Load}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q can be fired if the amount of outcome instances received for a probe in a sampling window is greater than what the user defines:
    \begin{center}
        \#instances$_{probe}$($\Delta$Q($t_l, t_u, dMax$)) > maxAllowedInstances 
    \end{center}

    \subsection{QTA}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q can be fired if:
        \begin{center}
            $\Delta$Q$_{obs}$ $\nless$ observableQTA
        \end{center}
