\chapter{Design}
    This chapter aims to first extend the concepts of $\Delta$QSD, giving more insights into how the systems need to be instrumented to correctly work together, and how the different parts need to be integrated to interact together.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We first provide concepts of probes, we extend the $\Delta$QSD notion of failure and describe how time series will work in our oscilloscope, this part is crucial to understand how the measurements are done in real time.
        \item We then split the design of the oscilloscope in two. First explaining the Erlang side, where the system to be tested is. Secondly, we explain the C++ side. Both chapters explain how probes can be inserted and made to work together.
        \item Lastly, we provide high level concepts of triggers and execution windows, the key elements of the oscilloscope. 
    \end{itemize}
