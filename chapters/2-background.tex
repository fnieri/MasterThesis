\chapter{Background}
    This chapter aims to provide firstly a background of the concepts key to understanding the $\Delta$QSD paradigm.

    Secondly, we explain the observability solutions that have been explored for the oscilloscope, delving deeper into OpenTelemetry and its macros.
    
    We finish by explaining what we believe are the current limitations of OpenTelemetry and explaining where the paradigm and the oscilloscope comes in.
