\chapter{Background}
    This chapter aims to provide firstly a complete background of the concepts key to understanding the $\Delta$QSD, giving a good basis to grasp the concepts of \textbf{quality attenuation} ($\Delta$Q) and outcome diagrams (SD). 
    
    Secondly, we provide a comprehensive background into the observability solutions that have been explored for the oscilloscope, delving deeper into OpenTelemetry and its macros.
