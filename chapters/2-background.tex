\chapter{Background}
    This chapter aims to provide firstly a complete background of the concepts key to understanding the $\Delta$QSD.

    Secondly, we provide a comprehensive background into the observability solutions that have been explored for the oscilloscope, delving deeper into OpenTelemetry and its macros.
    
    We finish by explaining the current limitations of OpenTelemetry and explaining where our oscilloscope comes in.
