\section{Stub performance}
    We evaluated the performance of the stub to measure its impact in a normal execution, namely we tested the following calls which represent a normal usage of the wrapper.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{start\_span} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{end\_span}.
        \item \texttt{with\_span} with the following function: \texttt{fun() $\rightarrow$ ok.}
        \item \texttt{start\_span} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{fail\_span}.
    \end{itemize}

    We ran the simulation for 25000 subsequent iterations, these are the results.
