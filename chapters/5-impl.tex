\chapter{Oscilloscope: implementation}
    The following chapter gives a more technical description of the oscilloscope.
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item We provide a more in-depth look at the $\Delta$QSD concepts introduced in the previous chapter.
        \item We then explain how the $\Delta$Q adapter works, its API and the underlying mechanism that let us export outcome instances to the oscilloscope.
        \item Next we give a technical explanation of the parser generator we used to parse the outcome diagram syntax.
        \item Lastly, we briefly talk about the dashboard graphical framework.
    \end{itemize}
