\chapter{Oscilloscope: implementation}
    The following chapter gives a more technical description of the internals of the oscilloscope.
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item We provide a more in-depth look at the $\Delta$QSD concepts introduced in the previous chapter.
        \item We then explain how the $\Delta$Q adapter works, its API and the underlying mechanism that let us export outcome instances to the oscilloscope.
        \item Lastly, we briefly talk about the parser generator used to parse the outcome diagram syntax and the dashboard graphical framework.
    \end{itemize}
