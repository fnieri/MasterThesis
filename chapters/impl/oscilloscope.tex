\section{Oscilloscope GUI}
    Our oscilloscope graphical interface has been built using the QT framework for C++. Qt is a cross-platform application development framework for creating graphical user interfaces. \\
    We chose Qt as we believe that it is the most documented and practical library for GUI development in C++, using Qt allows us to create usable interfaces quickly, while being able to easily pair the backend code of C++ to the frontend.
