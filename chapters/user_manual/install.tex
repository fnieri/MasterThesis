\chapter{How to download and launch}
    To download the oscilloscope, go to the GitHub repository (\url{https://github.com/fnieri/DeltaQOscilloscope/}) and go to the releases page, there, you will find the different versions of the oscilloscope. For instruction purposes, we have made a pre-release to show where to find it.

    The dq\_oscilloscope binary is the binary to download. By launching the binary on the CLI with:
    \begin{minted}{text}
        ./dq_oscilloscope
    \end{minted}
    The oscilliscope will launch.
