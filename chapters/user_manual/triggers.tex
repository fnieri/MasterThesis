\section{Triggers}
    In the triggers section you can define which triggers to apply for a given probe, once selected, they will be automatically activated.

    Once a trigger is triggered, the oscilloscope will keep recording the system for a few seconds. Once stopped, under the "snapshots" section, you can click the snapshots to view them in a separate section, there, you can observe the $\Delta$Qs of all the probes before and after the trigger was triggered. You can discard the snapshot by left clicking on it and clicking \textit{"Deleted snapshot"}.
