\chapter{Oscilloscope: User level concepts}
    The following chapter gives insights on the user level concepts of $\Delta$QSD in the oscilloscope. They are the concepts needed by the user to understand how the oscilloscope works.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We first provide insights into how $\Delta$QSD was implemented in the oscilloscope, the parameters that define a probe's $\Delta$Q, its representation and what can be done with $\Delta$Qs. We show how probe's $\Delta$Q(s) will be shown in the oscilloscope.
        \item We then provide a language to write outcome diagrams based on an already existing syntax.
        \item Lastly, we explain the different controls present on the oscilloscope dashboard.
    \end{itemize}
