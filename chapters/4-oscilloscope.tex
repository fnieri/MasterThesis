\chapter{Oscilloscope: User level concepts}
    The following chapter gives insights on the concepts of $\Delta$QSD in the oscilloscope needed by the user to understand how the oscilloscope works.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We first provide insights into how $\Delta$QSD was implemented in the oscilloscope, the parameters that define a probe's $\Delta$Q, its representation and what can be done with $\Delta$Qs. We show how a probe $\Delta$Q will be shown in the oscilloscope
        \item We then provide a language to write outcome diagrams based on an already existing syntax.
        \item Lastly, we explain how to control the system in the oscilloscope and how to interact with the stub
    \end{itemize}
