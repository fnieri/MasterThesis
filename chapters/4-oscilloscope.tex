\chapter{Oscilloscope: User level concepts}
    The following chapter gives insights on the user level concepts of $\Delta$QSD in the oscilloscope. They are the concepts needed by the user to understand how the oscilloscope works.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We first provide insights into how the concepts related $\Delta$QSD are implemented in the oscilloscope, the parameters that define a probe's $\Delta$Q, its representation. We show how probe's $\Delta$Q(s) will be shown in the oscilloscope.
        \item We then provide a language to write outcome diagrams based on an already existing syntax and provide an example.
        \item Lastly, we explain the different widgets on the oscilloscope dashboard and the available triggers.
    \end{itemize}
