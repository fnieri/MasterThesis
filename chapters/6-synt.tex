\chapter{Application on synthetic programs}
    This section aims to provide an example of how the oscilloscope could be used to instrument an application, in this case, a synthetic one. We explain how the $\Delta$QSD paradigm can be applied to explore tradeoffs in design and to gain more insights into a running system.
