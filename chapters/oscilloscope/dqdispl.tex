\section{$\Delta$Q display}
    An observable's displayed graph must contain the following functions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The mean and confidence bounds of a window of previous $\Delta$Qs
        \item The observed $\Delta$Q($t_l, t_u, dMax$)
        \item For a probe, the calculated $\Delta$Q from its components.
        \item Its QTA
    \end{itemize}
    This allows for the user to observe if a $\Delta$Q has deviated from normal execution, analyse its stationarity, nonlinearity and observe its execution.
