\section{Triggers}
    There are two available triggers
    \subsection{Load}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q can be fired if the amount of outcome instances received in a polling rate is greater than what the user defines:
    \begin{center}
        nSamples($\Delta$Q($t_l, t_u, dMax$)) > maxAllowedInstances 
    \end{center}

    \subsection{QTA}
        A trigger on an observed $\Delta$Q can be fired if:
        \begin{center}
            $\Delta$Q$_{obs}$ $<$ observableQTA
        \end{center}
